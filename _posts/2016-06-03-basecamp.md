<em>My wife thinks I'm crazy...that one of my life goals is to climb Mt. Everest.</em>

I know that getting my skill level to the point where that's possible will be a 
lot of work. If I want to make it a reality, I'll need to train everyday with 
that goal in mind.

After starting the Bloc Engineering Program, I can see
a parallel between both things. If I don't do something everyday to progress my 
skill level, it will only be a dream to complete the goal I have about climbing 
Mt. Everest, or of becoming a skilled software engineer. It's been tough to begin 
the "climb", however when I've finally understood a concept, figured out why I 
was getting an esoteric error, our discovered a method I could use that would
solve all my problems (or at least the one I was encountering at the time), the 
feeling of finally "getting it" has made the struggle worthwhile. The Bloc 
curriculum has helped fill in the gaps, however just like a climber using a 
ladder as a bridge to cross a seemingly bottomless pit of death, if you miss a 
step, you could get lost.

That picture...the one you see of a climber who summits and the look of 
accomplishment they have, the feeling of victory, standing at the top of Mt. 
Everest, planting your victory flag then taking that coveted "victory picture". 
I am looking forward to that feeling once I can finally call myself a 
"Software Engineer".

It's going to be a long climb, and there will be good days and bad. However I'm 
going to enjoy the journey no matter how long and difficult it may be and take 
one step at a time till I summit.
