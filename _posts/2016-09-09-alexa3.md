book me : top book finder

The final skill I decided to develop for this project was a book finder skill. This skill will help you discover 
the next book to read from the top books of all time by providing you the name, description and info about the book.
<br>

So, the Alexa skill I created is called "Book Me". After launching the skill,
you ask Alexa to "Book me", "give me a good book to read" or a number of other intutive programmed phrases and she will
answer you with the name of a top book of all time, the author, publish date and book description.
<br>
<br>
At the root of this skill is a fact app, however I also implimented a card for each book, so after you hear the book info, 
you can log into the Alexa web portal to see the extended book info and book cover picture for all the books that you heard.
<br>
<br>
After making this app, and reading all of these book descriptions, it's really made me want to up my reading game and make sure
that I not only keep up with my goal of reading one book a month, but increase that to one book a week...and add some rare first editions
to my personal library!
