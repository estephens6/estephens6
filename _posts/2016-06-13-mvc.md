Gone are the days of the ages 4 and up puzzles! My latest puzzle is MVC.

Although MVC (model-view-controller)
is an excellent way to know where everything goes, it does take some practice to master and know
where each loose thread is tied to.
I'm not there yet, but with every Model, View or Controller that I "g", I get one 
more "generated" under my belt, and one step closer to mastery.

During my latest late night Googling session, to broaden my understanding of the 
MVC concept while taking a break from my Bloc checkpoint, I ran accross 
Kalid Azad's <a href="http://betterexplained.com/">Better Explained</a>, and found his <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/starting-ruby-on-rails-what-i-wish-i-knew/">introduction to Rails</a> and 
<a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/intermediate-rails-understanding-models-views-and-controllers/">Understanding Models, Views and Controllers</a>
articles to be a helpful resource to get a quick big picture refresher download of some core concepts in a well
written post.

Some of the corner pieces to this Ruby on Rails puzzle.
