<em>alexa,<strong> Brad Pitt Facts</strong></em>

<br>
brad pitt : facts of life

The next skill I decided to develop was a fact skill. I originally was going to do fact skill of one 
of my favorite movies...Fight Club...but I didn't find enough facts about the movie (around 25), and I
wanted at least 50, so I decided to pick Brad Pitt as the subject of the skill.
<br>

So, the Alexa skill I created is called "Brad Pitt Facts". After launching the app,
Alexa tells you a fact from Brad Pitts personal or professional life. 
<br>
<br>
It's a very simple fact app, that I created using the helpful Amazon provided template
<br>
<br>
It's pretty cool making these Alexa skills, and I'm enjoying the process. I also found a 
cool podcast published by Mark Carpenter that talks all about Alexa apps and recommends some
good ones to check out. You can listen and subscribe <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/talking-alexa/id1150803413?mt=2">here</a>
