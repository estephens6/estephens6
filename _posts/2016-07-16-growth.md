<em>real<strong>:growth</strong></em>

Sometimes there are unexpected side effects to things.

One of the reasons that I enrolled in the Bloc Software Engineering course is the one-on-one mentorship that you receive...and
that has had some unexpected benefits. Twice a week I virtually "meet" with my mentor who helps me work 
through any programming concepts and questions that I have. Honestly, sometimes while asking questions
I feel myself cringe as I struggle to convey what I'm talking about translated into "code talk". I'm finding 
that it's just part of the growth process, and is a victory in my book when I am able to quickly and concisely 
ask a question and understand the answer.

Not all of the session is going over code. One of the "side effects" is we also talk about books that are good 
reads to improve habits, life outlooks and function. One of the books that my mentor recommended to me 
was <em>"Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It" (by Kamal Ravikant)</em>. It's a quick read that gives you 
some good truth to live by. If you haven't read it, I recommend it. One of the many takeaways I got from it, and 
have already applied when my climb up coding mountain has taken a difficult turn is this:

<strong>"Real growth comes through intense, difficult, and challenging situations."</strong>

So the next time I'm struggling through a tough concept and feel like I'll never "get it", I'm just going to realize
that this is the time...<em>RIGHT NOW</em>, that I'm actually experiencing real growth.

oh yeah...and one more thing...

to never forget that...I love myself. I love myself. I love myself.
