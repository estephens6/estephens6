alexa: bringing the space age home.

Going through my Bloc program, I'm able to pick some of the projects I want to work on. The current
project that I picked was to create an Alexa app. For anyone that doesn't know who/what "Alexa" is...Alexa
is Amazonâ€™s voice control system. It lets you speak you play games, dim your lights, create shopping lists, play music tracks,
and you're even able to order a pizza!

The first Alexa app I created is called "Gates Jobs Buffett, who said it". After launching the app,
Alexa tells you a quote that one of these industry titans has said, and you have to answer who you 
think said the quote.
<br>
<br>
It's a very simple trivia app, but it was only the first of 3 that I'm going to be creating this next week. It
was helpful that Amazon provided templates, how to documents and free AWS services to create this app. Once it's 
approved and released, it will be offered to users to activate and use for free.
<br>
<br>
The next one will be a Fact Skill, and the last one will be one of my design. I'm really glad to have 
picked this project so I could learn how to create apps for this new product that I believe is going to
totally change how people interact using their voice with everyday objects to bring the space age home.
